# Style Guide

## Principles we use in this project

- It should be modular / component-based to promote reuse and easier maintenance in the future.
- It shouldn't be as complicated as a full BEM architecture, it should just introduce the student to object oriented CSS.

## Style principles

### 1. The Single Responsibility Principle

One piece of code (in this case a class) should do one thing and one thing only.

### 2. The Open/Closed Principle

Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. 

### 3. The Separation of Concerns
