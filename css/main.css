  #LAYOUT-STYLES
\*------------------------------------*/

/*
We use the following classes to create a very basic grid.

The .layout element creates a fluid container which is the immediate child of
the body. Inside that there is two kinds of layout containers: a 100% wide and
a 90% wide one.

The grid is capable of creating a three-column layout. The .layout__item--one-
third div takes up the 30%  of the available space and is floated to the left,
creating the three-column layout. It is only triggered upwards from 768px
thanks to a media query. Floats are cleared via a pseudo- element and a
dedicated class.

The vertical rhythm is established through a single margin-bottom declaration
on the .layout__item class. Since this class is present on every grid item, it
can create a uniform margin spacing.

The three column layout needs gutters. This is solved through margin
declarations for the first and last column. The width of the columns is
established as 30%, the remaining 9.9% is divided between a right margin for
the first and a left margin for the last column. (Note: This could've been
done way more easier through flexbox with a space-between value.)
